MOVEMENT REVAMP
Add icon change when running vs jumping. - I'm not sure this is necessary.  If the flip up and flip down features are working then this shouldn't matter.
* What happens when you run into a wall?  - You grab onto it.  
* When you run off the edge of a platform instead of just falling, flip down and stick to the wall so you are ready to jump.
* Either eliminate the running through spikes, or add more situations where it is useful. - Eliminate,  would interact funny with some of the other planned changes.
Add a "flip up" feature when you are close to a corner and you try to jump through it.  Transition from surface to surface.
* Drop down when you are on a wall and you click below you even if the angle isn't perfect.  Loosen this requirement.
